What is Quality?
Quality is extremely hard to define, and it is simply stated: "Fit for use or purpose." It is all about meeting the needs and expectations of customers with respect to functionality, design, reliability, durability, & price of the product.

What is Assurance?
Assurance is nothing but a positive declaration on a product or service, which gives confidence. It is certainty of a product or a service, which it will work well. It provides a guarantee that the product will work without any problems as per the expectations or requirements.
